Assignment 01: Version Control (a.k.a assignment02)

  This is Assignment 01: Version Control, but the requirements were to 
   "Create the package cse360assignment02" 
      and 
   "Add a  file AddingMachine.java to this package."


    Assignment Instructions:

    Create the initial version: 
        -Document this file using the Javadoc comment style but do not make any 
            code changes to the file at this time. Most of the methods are blank.
        -Commit the project to git and github (or bitbucket)

    Create the second version
        Make the following changes to the AddingMachine file:

        -Use the normal operators for the operations (+, -).
        -There is no limit on the size of the String returned.
        -The format of the String should separate all operations and values with a 
            space. For example:
                myCalculator.add (4); 
                myCalculator.subtract (2); 
                myCalculator.add(5);
            then the toString method should return
                "0 + 4 â€“ 2 + 5"

    -Add other variables as needed to the class. Any additional variables must be 
        private. Make changes to the other methods if needed.
    -Update all documentations as needed
    -*Do not modify the function signature (the method name, parameters and 
        return type).
    -Test your solution and then commit the project to git and github. 
        (or bitbucket)

  Submit your java file (AddingMachine.java) on Canvas.
